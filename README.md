# TypeTune

## What is TypeTune? 
Whether you're writing an email, a eulogy, or a few lines of code, TypeTune is the place for you to type. Simply open the app, choose a synth that matches the mood of your work, create your composition (each letter plays a note), then hit playback to hear your text turned into music. Sign in to save your masterpiece.
